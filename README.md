## üåç Climate Tipping Points: How Renewables & Efficiency Cut CO‚ÇÇ for a Greener Future

### Introduction & Motivation

As climate urgency grows, the European Union has raised its renewable energy targets ‚Äî from **32% by 2030** under the *Recast Renewable Energy Directive (2018/2001/EU)* to **at least 42.5%**, with an ambition to reach **45%**, under the *Revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU/2023/2413)*  
([source](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-targets_en)).

But are these thresholds enough to trigger meaningful decarbonisation?

In this independent project, I investigate **climate tipping points** ‚Äî moments when renewable energy adoption and efficiency improvements begin to produce measurable reductions in CO‚ÇÇ emissions. Using global datasets, I apply statistical validation and interactive visualisation to identify key drivers accelerating or hindering the path to net zero.

The analysis explores:
- Whether exceeding a 30% renewables share represents a tipping point in emissions per capita,
- The role of energy efficiency and financial flows in influencing decarbonisation,
- And which regions are advancing ‚Äî or lagging ‚Äî in the energy transition.

The aim is to transform complex data into practical insights that highlight where climate action is taking hold ‚Äî and where greater momentum is needed.


### Project Objectives

- Quantify how renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency relate to CO‚ÇÇ emissions across countries and over time.
- Detect structural **tipping points** ‚Äî thresholds where emission reductions begin to accelerate.
- Deliver actionable insights through an interactive dashboard designed to support policy decisions and further research.


### Business Case

Uneven global progress on decarbonisation highlights the need for data-driven insights to guide investments and policies where they can deliver the greatest impact.


### Project Overview

This project analyses and visualises the key drivers influencing sustainable energy transitions and climate outcomes across countries ‚Äî identifying where and how tipping points for positive change can be reached. It combines data analytics, statistical validation, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to equip decision-makers and the public with clear, actionable insights.


### Problem Statement

Despite global commitments through initiatives like the EU Green Deal and COP28, progress toward decarbonisation remains uneven. Key drivers such as GDP, population, economic development, energy policy, and energy efficiency vary significantly across countries and regions. This project uncovers these disparities and identifies tipping points where climate action begins to accelerate.


### Project Plan

**Tools & Workflow:**  
- GitHub repo with Kanban board for task tracking  
- Development and analysis in VS Code  
- Deployment via Streamlit Community Cloud  

**High-Level Agile Project Plan (5 Days)**

| Day   | Tasks                                                                 |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1 | ETL: Clean, normalise, and merge variables; create threshold flag     |
| Day 2 | EDA: Summary statistics, correlation matrix, and initial visualisation |
| Day 3 | Statistical tests (H1, H3) and breakpoint analysis (H2)               |
| Day 4 | Build Streamlit components (plots + narrative), test, fix bugs, deploy |
| Day 5 | Documentation: Write README, summarise conclusions, update project board |


### MVP Deliverables

- Cleaned and enriched dataset enabling per-capita and regional analysis  
- Statistical validation of three climate-related hypotheses  
- Deployed Streamlit dashboard featuring at least four types of visualisations  
- Comprehensive README and annotated Jupyter Notebooks documenting the workflow


### Contingency Plan

- **Dashboard fallback:** If Streamlit deployment runs into issues, I‚Äôll consult my AI buddies for alternatives and pivot to Tableau Public or Power BI if needed.  
- **Analysis support:** When stuck, I‚Äôll lean on AI suggestions to explore alternative methods or visualisation ideas.


### Hypotheses & Deliverables

| Hypothesis | Rationale & Deliverables |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **H1: Renewables Share vs CO‚ÇÇ**<br>‚ÄúHigher renewables share is associated with lower CO‚ÇÇ‚ÄØper‚ÄØcapita.‚Äù | - **Data work:** Extract renewables share and CO‚ÇÇ per capita from cleaned dataset<br>- **Stats:** Pearson or Spearman correlation, plus OLS regression<br>- **Dashboard:** Line chart + scatterplot with trendline to visualise the relationship |
| **H2: Renewables Tipping Point**<br>‚ÄúAbove 30% renewables, CO‚ÇÇ declines accelerate.‚Äù | - **Data work:** Flag years with ‚â•30% renewables share<br>- **Stats:** Segmented (breakpoint) regression with interaction term; Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test as needed<br>- **Dashboard:** Before/after bar chart + tipping point alert |
| **H3: Energy Intensity vs CO‚ÇÇ**<br>‚ÄúLower energy intensity (MJ per $ of GDP) correlates with lower CO‚ÇÇ‚ÄØper‚ÄØcapita.‚Äù | - **Data work:** Integrate energy intensity metric and GDP<br>- **Stats:** Spearman correlation and OLS regression controlling for GDP<br>- **Dashboard:** Bubble or bar chart comparing countries |
