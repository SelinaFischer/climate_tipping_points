## üåç Climate Tipping Points: How Renewables & Efficiency Cut CO‚ÇÇ for a Greener Future

### Introduction & Motivation

As climate urgency grows, the European Union has raised its renewable energy targets ‚Äî from **32% by 2030** under the *Recast Renewable Energy Directive (2018/2001/EU)* to **at least 42.5%**, with an ambition to reach **45%**, under the *Revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU/2023/2413)*  
([source](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-targets_en)).

But are these thresholds enough to trigger meaningful decarbonisation?

In this independent project, I investigate **climate tipping points** ‚Äî moments when renewable energy adoption and efficiency improvements begin to produce measurable reductions in CO‚ÇÇ emissions. Using global datasets, I apply statistical validation and interactive visualisation to identify key drivers accelerating or hindering the path to net zero.

The analysis explores:
- Whether exceeding a 30% renewables share represents a tipping point in emissions per capita,
- The role of energy efficiency and financial flows in influencing decarbonisation,
- And which regions are advancing ‚Äî or lagging ‚Äî in the energy transition.

The aim is to transform complex data into practical insights that highlight where climate action is taking hold ‚Äî and where greater momentum is needed.


### Project Objectives

- Quantify how renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency relate to CO‚ÇÇ emissions across countries and over time.
- Detect structural **tipping points** ‚Äî thresholds where emission reductions begin to accelerate.
- Deliver actionable insights through an interactive dashboard designed to support policy decisions and further research.


### Business Case

Uneven global progress on decarbonisation highlights the need for data-driven insights to guide investments and policies where they can deliver the greatest impact.


### Project Overview

This project analyses and visualises the key drivers influencing sustainable energy transitions and climate outcomes across countries ‚Äî identifying where and how tipping points for positive change can be reached. It combines data analytics, statistical validation, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to equip decision-makers and the public with clear, actionable insights.


### Problem Statement

Despite global commitments through initiatives like the EU Green Deal and COP28, progress toward decarbonisation remains uneven. Key drivers such as GDP, population, economic development, energy policy, and energy efficiency vary significantly across countries and regions. This project uncovers these disparities and identifies tipping points where climate action begins to accelerate.


### Project Plan

**Tools & Workflow:**  
- GitHub repo with Kanban board for task tracking  
- Development and analysis in VS Code  
- Deployment via Streamlit Community Cloud  

**High-Level Agile Project Plan (5 Days)**

| Day   | Tasks                                                                 |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1 | ETL: Clean, normalise, and merge variables; create threshold flag     |
| Day 2 | EDA: Summary statistics, correlation matrix, and initial visualisation |
| Day 3 | Statistical tests (H1, H3) and breakpoint analysis (H2)               |
| Day 4 | Build Streamlit components (plots + narrative), test, fix bugs, deploy |
| Day 5 | Documentation: Write README, summarise conclusions, update project board |

**Data Management Approach:**  
Data was collected from public sources (Kaggle, World Bank, UNSD) and harmonised across time and geography. Processing involved renaming columns, merging population data, handling missing values, creating per-capita and log-transformed features, and engineering indicators such as `above_30_pct`. Cleaned datasets were stored in GitHub and reused across both analysis and dashboard layers.

**Methodology Rationale:**  
The project combined descriptive analysis with statistical validation to balance clarity and rigour. Correlation analysis was used to explore associations, while OLS and segmented regression tested the strength and structure of relationships. This allowed both quantitative insight and policy-relevant interpretation, especially regarding the 30% renewables tipping point.



### MVP Deliverables

- Cleaned and enriched dataset enabling per-capita and regional analysis  
- Statistical validation of three climate-related hypotheses  
- Deployed Streamlit dashboard featuring at least four types of visualisations  
- Comprehensive README and annotated Jupyter Notebooks documenting the workflow


### Contingency Plan

- **Dashboard fallback:** If Streamlit deployment runs into issues, I‚Äôll consult my AI buddies for alternatives and pivot to Tableau Public or Power BI if needed.  
- **Analysis support:** When stuck, I‚Äôll lean on AI suggestions to explore alternative methods or visualisation ideas.

### Business Requirements

- Identify and visualise the key drivers of the global energy transition  
- Provide actionable insights to support decision-making by policymakers, analysts, and researchers  
- Enable scenario exploration by country, region, subregion, and year to reveal geographic and temporal patterns  
- Communicate complex findings in a clear, accessible way through data storytelling and interactive visualisation


## Hypotheses and How to Validate

This project is guided by three hypotheses related to the role of renewable energy and energy efficiency in reducing CO‚ÇÇ emissions:

### H1: Renewables Share vs CO‚ÇÇ per Capita  
**Hypothesis:** Countries with a higher share of renewable energy have lower CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita.  
**Validation Approach:**  
- Calculate correlations (Spearman and OLS regression) between `renewables_share_pct` and `co2_per_capita_t`  
- Visualise relationships using scatterplots with trendlines

### H2: Tipping Point at 30% Renewables  
**Hypothesis:** Countries with a renewables share above 30% experience a structural decline in CO‚ÇÇ emissions.  
**Validation Approach:**  
- Create a binary flag (`above_30_pct`) to compare average emissions below and above the threshold  
- Apply segmented regression with interaction terms and visualise results  
- Support with a 2020-only bar chart comparing the two groups

### H3: Energy Intensity vs CO‚ÇÇ per Capita  
**Hypothesis:** Countries with lower energy intensity (MJ per $ GDP) emit less CO‚ÇÇ per capita.  
**Validation Approach:**  
- Test correlation between `energy_intensity_mj_usd` and `co2_per_capita_t`  
- Use OLS regression controlling for `gdp_pc_usd` to account for development level  
- Plot emissions vs energy intensity using scatterplots, coloured by GDP

Each hypothesis is tested using both statistical validation and visual storytelling to ensure interpretability and support evidence-based conclusions.


## The Rationale to Map the Business Requirements to the Data Visualisations

This project‚Äôs data visualisations were designed to directly support the core business requirements through meaningful, interpretable outputs. Below is a breakdown of each requirement and the rationale for the selected visual approach.

### 1. Identify and visualise key drivers of the energy transition  
**Visualisations used:**  
- Correlation matrix and scatterplots for key variable pairs  
- Time-series and trendlines showing how renewables share and energy intensity evolve  
**Rationale:**  
These visuals help isolate relationships between variables such as renewables share, energy intensity, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions, allowing analysts to spot the most influential drivers.

### 2. Provide actionable insights for stakeholders  
**Visualisations used:**  
- Tipping point bar chart comparing CO‚ÇÇ per capita above vs below 30% renewables  
- Country-level plots with GDP, energy metrics, and emissions  
**Rationale:**  
By visualising structural shifts and emissions performance across thresholds, the dashboard highlights where policy action has been most effective ‚Äî enabling evidence-based recommendations.

### 3. Enable scenario exploration by country, region, subregion, and year  
**Visualisations used:**  
- Sidebar filters for country, region, and subregion  
- Line charts and scatterplots showing changes over time  
**Rationale:**  
Interactive filters and temporal visualisations allow users to explore emissions and energy patterns geographically and over the 2000‚Äì2020 period, enabling scenario analysis across space and time.


### 4. Communicate complex insights accessibly  
**Visualisations used:**  
- Cleanly annotated scatterplots, bar charts, and line graphs  
- Structured narrative embedded in the dashboard  
**Rationale:**  
The use of accessible visual formats and straightforward statistical overlays enables non-technical users to engage with insights without needing advanced analytical skills.

Each visual was chosen not just for analytical clarity but to support communication, exploration, and evidence-based decision-making aligned with stakeholder needs.


## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?


## Analysis Techniques Used

This project combined descriptive statistics, hypothesis-driven regression, and visual analytics to validate the relationships between energy transition indicators and CO‚ÇÇ emissions. The techniques were chosen to balance statistical rigour with interpretability for both technical and non-technical audiences.

### Analytical Methods

- **Descriptive Statistics & Correlation Analysis**  
  Used to summarise distributions and explore initial relationships between key variables such as `renewables_share_pct`, `energy_intensity_mj_usd`, and `co2_per_capita_t`. Spearman correlation was preferred due to the non-normal distribution of some variables.

- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**  
  Applied to test the strength of association between predictors and outcomes while controlling for GDP and other confounders. Log-transformed variables were used to reduce skew and improve model fit.

- **Segmented (Tipping Point) Regression**  
  Used to test Hypothesis 2 ‚Äî whether a structural change in emissions occurs when renewables share exceeds 30%. This involved an interaction term (`above_30_pct * renew_share`) to capture changes in slope beyond the threshold.

- **Bar Chart Comparison (2020 Snapshot)**  
  To complement the regression analysis, a simple 2020-only bar chart was used to visually validate whether countries above the 30% renewables threshold had significantly lower emissions ‚Äî supporting accessibility and visual impact.

### Data Structuring

The dataset was structured as a **panel (country-year)** format, allowing both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis. Per capita indicators were derived by merging World Bank population data. Log-transformed features and a tipping point binary flag were added to support regression modelling. This structure allowed for flexible slicing across country, region, subregion, and time.

### Limitations & Alternative Approaches

- **Data Gaps:**  
  Some countries had missing population data or incomplete records across years. To address this, rows with critical missing values (e.g. emissions, renewables share) were dropped during cleaning. The impact was monitored using `_miss` indicator flags.

- **Statistical Constraints:**  
  Due to limited data points for some smaller countries or regions, the project did not use fixed-effects panel regression or clustering, which would require more consistent time-series coverage. Instead, analysis focused on aggregate patterns and cross-sectional validation (e.g. 2020 snapshot).

- **Causality:**  
  The analysis is observational and correlational. While relationships are statistically significant, causality cannot be inferred without experimental or time-lagged data.


### Use of Generative AI

Generative AI tools played a valuable supporting role across ideation, analysis, and delivery. They helped streamline workflows, improve clarity, and accelerate code development ‚Äî while all analysis, validation, and decision-making were independently executed and manually verified.

- **ChatGPT** was used to:
  - Support ideation and framing of hypotheses, such as identifying the 30% renewables tipping point from policy benchmarks
  - Assist in design thinking for dashboard structure, interactive filters, and storytelling flow
  - Optimise and debug Python code, particularly in Streamlit and Plotly visualisations
  - Refine language and structure across documentation, markdown explanations, and README reporting

- **GitHub Copilot** assisted with:
  - Code auto-completion and pattern suggestions in VS Code
  - Fixing minor logic and syntax issues in data wrangling, feature engineering, and visualisation steps
  - Accelerating development during repetitive tasks (e.g. grouped transformations, plot annotation)

- **Abacus.AI** was used to:
  - Generate the project‚Äôs visual cover image for the README 
  - Contribute to early-stage ideation and planning of the project workflow

These tools served as valuable thought partners for improving efficiency, visual design, and clarity ‚Äî while all analysis, validation, and interpretation were conducted independently to ensure the project remained both technically sound and professionally presented.


### Ethical Considerations

This project used publicly available, aggregate-level data from reputable sources including the World Bank, Kaggle, and the United Nations. As such, there were no individual or personally identifiable records involved, and no data privacy risks were present.

Potential fairness or bias concerns were primarily related to:
- **Data coverage and completeness** ‚Äî Some countries had missing or inconsistent records, especially in earlier years or less economically developed regions.
- **Comparability across contexts** ‚Äî Emissions and energy data vary widely by economic development level, infrastructure, and policy environment, which may affect the interpretation of cross-country comparisons.

These issues were addressed through:
- Subsetting the dataset to a consistent time period (2000‚Äì2020)  
- Using per-capita and log-transformed metrics to normalise for country size and economic scale  
- Visualising trends at regional and subregional levels to avoid overgeneralisation

No legal or intellectual property issues were encountered, as all data sources were open-access and properly cited. The analysis was conducted with the goal of supporting equitable and evidence-based climate planning, avoiding assumptions about causality, and presenting findings in a transparent and accessible manner.



## Dashboard Design

The dashboard was developed using **Streamlit** and evolved iteratively over 20+ design refinements. It provides an intuitive, interactive interface tailored for both technical and non-technical users to explore energy trends, validate hypotheses, and generate insights with clarity and control.

### Sidebar Filters

The sidebar supports dynamic filtering for user-driven exploration:

- **Geography Selector**  
  A nested region‚Äìsubregion‚Äìcountry tree built using `streamlit-tree-select`. Enables filtering at multiple geographic levels.  

- **Year Slider**  
  Allows users to select a year between 2000 and 2020. All visuals dynamically update accordingly.

- **Metric Toggle**  
  Enables switching between:
  - `renewables_share_pct` ‚Äì Renewables as a share of total energy
  - `co2_per_capita_t` ‚Äì CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita (tonnes)

### User Experience & Design Enhancements

- **Use of Expanders**  
  Collapse sections such as:
  - ‚ÄúHow the Filters Work‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúDescriptive Analysis‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúProject Workflow & Methodology‚Äù  
  This helps reduce visual noise and focus the reader‚Äôs attention on key charts.

- **Colour Consistency & Label Validation**  
  Regional and subregional colors are maintained across visuals. Geographic inconsistencies (e.g., ‚ÄúUK‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúUnited Kingdom‚Äù) are corrected in the backend to avoid mislabeling.

- **Error Handling**  
  Empty filters or incompatible selections trigger warning messages and fallback logic to maintain app stability.


### Design Evolution

The dashboard began with basic trend charts and map visualisations. Through a trial-and-error approach, hands-on prototyping, and iterative testing, several key design improvements were introduced:

- Incorporated **expander widgets** to reduce clutter and allow users to focus on key visuals.
- Added **predictive sliders** to make the insights interactive and participatory.
- Introduced **metric toggles, tooltips,** and **segmented visual blocks** to support guided storytelling and exploration.
- Refined **layout, spacing, and legend placement** to improve readability across screen sizes and devices.


### Communicating Insights

- **For Non-Technical Audiences**:  
  Clear labels, interactive sliders, and visual cues make the data approachable. Expanders hide complexity unless needed.

- **For Technical Audiences**:  
  Metric definitions, trend directions, and chart configurations support further exploration and hypothesis testing. Visual outputs align with key statistical validations (e.g., segmented regression for tipping point testing).


The final dashboard communicates complex climate and energy dynamics through a carefully structured and visually accessible interface ‚Äî enabling data-informed insight, scenario exploration, and public engagement on climate tipping points.


## Unfixed Bugs

### Subregion Misclassification

During post-deployment testing, a notable issue was identified in the **Geography** filter of the dashboard:

- When filtering for countries in **Northern Africa**, a country from **Western Europe** incorrectly appeared in the visualisation.![visual4 bug](image-1.png)
- This suggests a misclassification in the country-to-subregion mapping, despite defensive coding applied via the `FORCE_GEO` dictionary and validation logic.


### Why It Was Not Fixed

Due to time constraints, the issue was not fully investigated or resolved. It is considered a **known bug** and is documented for future improvement. The fix would likely involve:

- Strengthening validation logic in the `geo_meta` DataFrame
- Improving label harmonisation between the dataset and the sidebar filters


### Knowledge Gaps and How They Were Addressed

This issue surfaced several technical and practical gaps:

- **Region Metadata Normalisation:**  
  Handling mismatches in country names (e.g., "UK" vs "United Kingdom") required using a `FORCE_GEO` override and applying `enforce_geo_labels()` to consistently label geography columns.

> This section highlights the challenge of managing diverse global datasets and the importance of robust validation during the final deployment stage.
